# An OCaml tableau solver for unary linear temporal logic

This program is an implementation in OCaml of the tableau satisfiability solver for the (X,F) - fragment of LTL given in [Reynolds 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03962). 
It takes as input a formula, and returns `true` **and a model** if the formula is satisfiable, `false` if it is not. The solver also prints the development of the tree during model search.

A theoretical foundation for this solver is given by the *completeness* of the treated fragment of LTL with respect to the axiomatization, combined with the completeness of Reynolds' tableau procedure; see Theorem 3.3 in [Ghilardi and van Gool 2017](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-symbolic-logic/article/div-classtitlea-model-theoretic-characterization-of-monadic-second-order-logic-on-infinite-wordsdiv/6B7E629B0B30B876618FC9EBF0AB9996) and sections 7&8 in [Reynolds 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03962). Concretely, these theorems ensure that the solver will always give an output. 

This solver was written in Summer 2022 by Anatole Leterrier in the context of an MPRI (M2) internship at [IRIF](https://www.irif.fr) under the supervision of [Sam van Gool](https://www.samvangool.net). The solver is accompanied by a technical [internship report](./report.pdf) that provides theoretical background. We gratefully acknowledge the financial support for the internship from the [DIM Maths Innov](https://www.dim-mathinnov.fr/) program of the [FSMP](https://sciencesmaths-paris.fr/) and the ÃŽle-de-France region. 

# Overview of the source code

The main program is in the file [main.ml](./tableaux/src/main.ml); most importantly, it contains function `sat`, which is the main feature of our solver.

The tests are in the file [tests.ml](./tableaux/src/tests.ml).
# Dependencies

The program depends on the following software, which you need to install to be able to compile it on your own machine:

* First check installation for [opam version 2.1.2+](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html);

* Then install:

 [ocaml version 4.13.1+](https://ocaml.org/)
 
 [dune version 3.3.1+](https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/dune/)
 
 [ounit2 version 2.2.6+](https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/ounit2/)

 This is done in a terminal by typing `opam install` followed by the package name, for each of the three packages mentioned.

# Usage

To compile the program, while in the subfolder `tableaux`, execute the command `dune build` on a shell.

The current version of the program can be tested in two ways: 

1. By modifying the tests in the file `tests.ml`.

2. In an interactive toplevel such as `ocaml` or `utop`. To import the code, type:
` #use "./tableaux/src/main.ml";; `

You can now apply function "sat" on any LTL formula by typing:
`let _ = sat(phi) ;;` where phi is an LTL formula satisfyng the syntax given below:

* Propositional variables are written ` Prop 'p' `; that is, `Prop` is an operator taking a `char` as an argument);

* Binary operators for Conjunction and Disjunction: ` And(phi,psi) `, ` Or(phi,psi) ` ;

* Unary operators for Negation, Next, Finally, Globally: `Neg(phi)`, `X(phi)`, `F(phi)`, `G(phi)`.



Let us give an example. Typing `let _ = sat(And(Prop 'p',Or(Neg(Prop 'p'),Neg(X(Prop 'p')))))` we get the following output:
```
Testing satisfyability of p &(Neg p | Neg X p)

Node: p &(Neg p | Neg X p)
Node: p ; Neg p | Neg X p

Branching

Branch 1
Node: p ; Neg p

Contradiction rule has discarded this branch

Branch 2
Node: p ; Neg X p

Transition

Node: Neg p
Transition

Node: 
Empty rule has validated this branch

A model is:
p ; Neg p

p &(Neg p | Neg X p) is satisfyable


- : bool = true 
```

# Tests

There are several tests in the file `./src/tests.ml`. Many of these are unit tests, written during programming to ensure that the functions in `main.ml` were well written.

To execute all the tests, run the command

`dune exec src/tests.exe`

We have created a sequence of formulas that exhibits the worst-case performance of the solver. It corresponds to the "exponential case" test. This sequence of "worst-case formulas" is built by taking `Bot` at rank 0 (or any unsatisfiable formula), and out of rank n, build rank n+1 by taking the disjunction of two times the formula at rank n. The formula in the test case only has rank 5, however we have tested up to 13 nestings. Since the procedure is PSPACE-complete (see section 9 in [Reynolds 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03962)), we would expect an exponential time in function of the number of nestings in the worst case, which is what we seem to get. This is normal, as adding a nesting doubles the number of leaves, all of which end up crossed (so the algorithm has to check every one of them). A table and a graph in the report mentioned earlier bring further evidence of this fact.  

(TODO modify this to a precise reference to a section of your report)

# Known limitations

In case an eventuality subformula (F or G) is present and the program claims satisfiability with the "LOOP" rule, it will tell the user to loop to find the actual, infinite model (eg. `G(Prop 'p')`). The current version does not yet specify exactly where to loop; this point is left to future work. If the program does not end with the "LOOP" rule, an infinite model is found by choosing any valuation for the remaining states. It also happens that a propositional variable is present as a subformula, but not specified in the model. This means that the choice of the truth value for this variable is not relevant to the satisfiability of the formula (eg. with `Or(Prop 'p',Prop 'q')` it will simply tell to set variable `p` to true, and not specify a truth value for `q`).

The implementation can likely still be optimized for time and space performance, also see the discussion in Section x.y of the [report](./report.pdf) (TODO add precise reference).
