# An OCaml tableau solver for LTL

This program is an implementation of [Reynolds](https://...). It takes as input an LTL formula and outputs SAT and a Kripke model if the formula is satisfiable an UNSAT otherwise.

# Usage

To compile the program, execute the command

`install.sh`

on a shell.

To run the program, execute a command of the form

`./solver "And(Prop(p), Prop(q))"`

There are several tests in the subfolder ...

To execute all the tests, run the command

`./solver-test`

# Features

The solver supports LTL formulas of the following format:
...

Since the procedure is complete (for a proof, see for example [this report](./report.pdf)), the solver will always give an output. 

We have not yet made time performance optimizations.

# Tests

We have created a sequence of formulas that exhibits the worst-case performance of the solver. Since the procedure is PSPACE-complete (add reference?), ...
